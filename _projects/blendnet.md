## Description

Opensource Blender addon and distributed cloud rendering system.

## Authors

* Idea & realization: [Rabit](https://github.com/rabits)

## Usage

Please check out the wiki page: [Wiki](https://github.com/state-of-the-art/BlendNet/wiki)

## Requirements

* Blender 2.8
* Google Cloud Platform project and google cloud sdk

## Purpose

Existing blender addons, that enabling network rendering on a cluster of instances
are too complicated, not enough automated or too expensive. The solution is just
to use the existing cloud providers with their cheap preemptible instances costs
~3 times less than the regular ones.

For example `GCP` n1-highcpu-64 (**64 core 57.6GB RAM**) will cost you just
**$0.48 per hour**. Just imagine this - a quite complicated `Cycles engine` frame
will cost just $0.50.

## Overview

The system consists of 3 main parts:

* Addon - blender interface to simplify run and manage the tasks
* Manager - controls Agents, merges results, provides status to Addon
* Agent - worker of the system, rendering task, provides status to Manager

All the components are using HTTPS & Basic Auth to protect the connection.

Read more on the GitHub page: [README](https://github.com/state-of-the-art/BlendNet/)

### Features

* Dynamic preview - user can see the progress of rendering, picture updated every 5s (default)
* Non-destructive preview engine - you can close preview and open it again without interrupting
* Allow to create providers - right now supported local run & GCP
* Saves your money - if some resources are not needed right now - they will be terminated

## Plans

You can see all the feature requests/bugs on the github page:

* [Milestones](https://github.com/state-of-the-art/BlendNet/milestones)
* [Issues](https://github.com/state-of-the-art/BlendNet/issues)

### Tasks

* Use buckets to cache dependencies/results
* Cost estimation before rendering
* Denoising of the render result if option is enabled
* Distributed smoke baking (per-domain)
* Adding `AWS` and other cloud providers
* Allocating of preemptible GPU on the instances
* Detailed statistics to optimize the pipeline
* Simplify the setup process for the end-user
* Web interface to check the status

### OpenSource

This is an experimental project. The main goal is to test State of the Art philosophy in practice.

We would love to see independent developers working on the project's issues: for fun and interest
as well as for monetary compensation (say, attached to the tickets).

#### License

The repository and its contents are covered by `Apache v2.0`, so anyone can use it without any concerns.

If you have any changes you'd like to share, don't hesitate to make a pull-request and push them into
the original repository. Definitely no pressure though.

#### Build

There is no need to build the project, just download zip archive with the latest release from
[GitHub](https://github.com/state-of-the-art/BlendNet/releases) and install the addon using Blender
add-on installer.
